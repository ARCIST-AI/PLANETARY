## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`** - Stable production branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
- **`feature/description`** - New features
- **`fix/description`** - Bug fixes
- **`docs/description`** - Documentation updates
- **`perf/description`** - Performance improvements

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(physics): add relativistic effects to N-body calculation
fix(rendering): resolve memory leak in texture management
docs(api): update CelestialBody class documentation
test(celestial): add comprehensive Planet class tests
```

### Code Quality Standards

Before submitting code, ensure it meets our quality standards:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run check

# Individual checks
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format:check  # Prettier
npm test             # Tests with coverage
```

### Testing Requirements

- **All new features** must include comprehensive tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Maintain test coverage** above 90%
- **Performance-critical code** should include benchmarks

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure your code follows our standards**
2. **Write or update tests** for your changes
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Rebase on the latest main branch**

### PR Submission Process

1. **Create a descriptive title:**
   ```
   feat(physics): Add support for binary star systems
   ```

2. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Motivation and context
   - Testing done
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Breaking changes (if any)

3. **Link related issues:**
   ```
   Closes #123
   Relates to #456
   ```

4. **Request reviews** from relevant maintainers

### PR Review Process

- **Automated checks** must pass (linting, tests, build)
- **At least one maintainer** must approve
- **All conversations** must be resolved
- **No merge conflicts** with the target branch
